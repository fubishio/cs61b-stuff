1.False it is O(n)
2.True when the number of nodes increases by 1, steps go up by one, by 4, step goes up by 2, by 8, steps go up by 3
3.False it is Theta(logN)
4.True can't get worse
5.False it is O(n)
6.True searching is Theta LogN and inserting is Theta LogN so adding them together is 2LogN
7.False it should be 2LogN since the function is called twice
8.The big O notation of mystery function should be O(Z) since for some positive integer, the function will always recursively increment z by -1 in the absolute worst case scenario function so the function at most will be called around Z times.
